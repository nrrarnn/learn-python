# Definition of variables in Python

# A variable is a container for storing data values that can change.

# Here are examples of defining variable.

name = "Nur arini"
# The variable 'name' is assigned the value "Nur arini"

# Rules for writing variables
# 1. Variables names must start with a Letter or Underscore('_') 
#    - they cannot start with a number
valid_variable = 10
_valid_variable = 20
# 1invalid_variable = 30  # This will cause an error

# 2. Variable Names Can Only Contain Letters, Numbers, and Underscores:
#   - they cannot contain spaces or special characters like !, @, #, etc.
anotherValidVariable = 50
variable_2 = 60
# invalid-variable = 70  # This will cause an error

# 3. Variable Names are Case-Sensitive:
#   -myVariable and myvariable are considered different variables.
myVariable = 100
myvariable = 200

# Conventions for Writing Variables

# 1. Using snake_case for regular variables
user_name = "Arin"
user_age = 18
number_of_items = 3

# 2. Using uppercase letters for constants
MAX_USERS = 1000
PI = 3.14159

# 3. Using descriptive names
first_name = "Nur"
last_name = "Arini"
is_active_user = True
account_balance = 250.75
